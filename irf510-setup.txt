If you are speaking of RV1:

Turn the measured bias on the gate of the IRF510 to below 1v.
Connect the drain of the IRF510.
Measure the current draw of the rig in RX. It should be receiving ok.
Increase RV1 SLOWLY until there is about 100 ma. MORE current draw
at the drain of the IRF510. Measure the gate voltage. It should be around 3v.
Connect the drain of the IRF510 and speak into the mic. The increase
in current to the drain should be to around 1A (with12v on the drain).
If not, adjust R136 up until the current drain is about correct.

Voila. You are done.

There are finer adjustments including the BFO frequency, the mic drive, etc,
but this is the basic TX adjustment. Once it is made, more or less LEAVE IT ALONE.
Doing more stands one in good stead to blow up the IRF510.

Watch for oscillation in the final. This is almost always a too low impedance mismatch
at the drain. The usual fix is a 10 ohm resistor between the gate and the rest of the circuit.
which lowers the Q somewhat and dampens the oscillation. It has little effect on output
power (and is probably a very good mandatory mod actually; it's not mandatory because
not every IRF510 will oscillate).
